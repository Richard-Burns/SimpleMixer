# Simple Mixer
Simple Mixer is a real-time and video mixing tool built entirely in TouchDesigner. It's currently tested and working in build 2022.35280.

There's been a lot of one on one conversation regarding SimpleMixer and using it so I've now made a new discord in case anybody wants to discuss in a community manner:

##### How It Works

Simple Mixer uses four banks at the top left of the screen which can have clips and tox files loaded into them. They can then be mixed between using the sliders and the compositing mode can be set.

Toxs are shown in the panel on the bottom left. These can be loaded by placing the tox file into the Assets/Tox directory.

For a tox to be compatible with Simple Mixer at the bare minimum it must have a TOP operator named 'out1' and another named 'thumb' in order to function. It can also have a text DAT called 'name' which will show up in the Asset Browser. If your tox file is a container or has custom parameters these parameters will be exposed on the bottom right of the display when the tox is loaded into a bank and that bank is selected in the Current Visuals tab. If you want to set your tox files to the correct resolution then you can use the expressions op.output.par.Resolutionw and op.output.par.Resolutionh. To hook audio up to your component it's recommended to expose those parameters via custom parameters and then hook them up via the interface.

For audio analysis the system uses the audioanalysis component created by Greg Hermanovic. This has three different spectrum tabs you can select between and options for analysing particular frequencies. The CHOP itself is exposed ready to be hooked up to custom parameters directly in the interface.

At the very top of the screen is a tab to switch into mapping mode. This has two projection mapping tools. One is the stoner from the Palette and the second is Warpa which is a polygon drawing and warping tool.

###### Rich & Dithid - 1.1.3

New Features

- See audio playlist updates below (Thanks Tim)
- Turned audio playlists off by default and reverted to an empty scene for people pulling the first time.

###### Tim - 1.1.2

New Features
- A new tab was added in the grid allowing you to create audio playlists.
- The button to setup test audio was replaced with new page that allows you to configure either single test audio files or playlists.

Known Issues
- if the audio file is shorter than the transition weird things will happen.
- When you make changes to the configuration of the autoMediaPlayer you sometimes need to reset it via the Reset pulse button. You can do this directly from the UI by opening the Music configuration button.

###### 1.1.1

Bug Fixes
- Post FX went very very wonky after the Touch updates due to the way op connectors were changed when reinitializing .tox files. This should now be fixed.

###### 1.1.0

New Features
- Notch Support - Place your blocks in the Assets/Notch folder and they'll become available under the "Notch Blocks" tab.

Bug Fixes
- Post FX Sliders no longer default to 0 on startup.
- TouchDesigner Upgrade broke the OSC mapping, this is now fixed.
- Issue where the parameter window would sometimes not update fixed.

###### 1.0.0

Bug Fixes
- Sliders reverting to 0 should be fixed
- Right clicking on a bank now reverts to the original functionality of setting that bank as the active parameter window.

###### 0.9.8

New Features
- Upgraded the TOX preview pane on the bottom right hand side to show Base COMPs as well as panels.
- The TOX selector grid is now adaptable in size to avoid scrollbars and make everything quickly draggable. (Thanks Dith_Id for that one)

###### 0.9.7

Bug Fixes
- The drag drop bug workaround broke PostFX dragging. You can now drag to Post FX slots again but right clicking is disabled as drag drop is fixed. SimpleMixer now only works in 25850 ONLY.
- Menus now have scrollbars so they don't go off the screen if they are too large.

###### 0.9.3  - BETA

Bug Fixes
- Drag Drop can now be avoided by selecting the TOX/Movie you wish to assign and right clicking the bank you want to assign it to. For PostFX you can simply select a bank and then left click the Post Effect you want to apply to it.
- Movie thumbnails should load properly now (seriousssslllyyy)
- UI error fixes when there are no secondary monitors present.
- Clear All Mappings button in settings now actually clears all mappings rather than just erroring.

Things To Note
- There seems to be an issue with menus loading slowly in some scenarios. This will be addressed in the next version.

###### 0.9.0 - BETA

New Features
- Gal is gone! We now have a completely new UI system that is both scaleable and MIDI/OSC/Key/UDP/Artnet Mappable.
- The new settings tab allows you to specify which inputs you are using and customize the highlight colour.
- Remove mappings in Settings by clicking the "Clear All Mappings" button.
- Halfway to the 1.0.0 release in which I hope to rebuild the Parameter COMP into a fully mappable system. For now you can use the container setup to map things in.

Notes
- Would really love it if people could report issues as I imagine there will be quite a few with this build.

###### 0.5.0

New Features
- You can now change the levels and hue parameters directly on movie clips.
